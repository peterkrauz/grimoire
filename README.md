# Grimoire :crystal_ball: :open_book:
## What is this
Grimoire (pronounced **gruhm Â· waar**) is a hobby app that employs several Android modern technologies and best practices. <br>
It is currently a work in progress being slowly refined weekend by weekend, for usage on my not-so-regular tabletop RPG gaming sessions.

> ## Characteristics
Besides having been built 100% with Kotlin, it has a [single-activity](app/src/main/java/com/peterkrauz/grimoire/MainActivity.kt) and performs navigation
with Jetpack's Navigation Component. Fragments and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)s interact with one another
through the usage of [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)s, employing a unidirectional data flow on our presentation layer.

> ## Architecture
In search of achieving a [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), the common monolithic Android structure
was dismembered into multiple modules.
